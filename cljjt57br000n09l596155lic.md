### **👋 Hello there!**

We might have all been there and have had to develop multiple JS/TS projects in the organization we're working for, and we know it is not wise to just copy code from the old project to start in the new project because we see things could be reusable among the projects.

That's where we come up with building an **SDK *(Software Development Kit)***, simply an NPM package containing all the reusable functionalities that can be used across projects.

It is not hard to just build an NPM package and publish to the NPM registry and use it in multiple projects.

However, the problem here is NPM registry is "PUBLIC" 😏 and we don't want to or have conditions in our organization not to publish the package to the public.

That's what we are trying to solve 😃

<div data-node-type="callout-text">Of course, you can publish private packages to the NPM registry. But just it is not free (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://docs.npmjs.com/about-private-packages" style="pointer-events: none">https://docs.npmjs.com/about-private-packages</a>). Somehow in your organization, you already have a repository manager self-hosted (e.g. Nexus), and that is the direction we are going in this blog.</div>
</div>

Let's get started on what we need to do:

1. Install Docker
    
2. Run a container of Nexus Repo
    
3. Configure Nexus Repo for NPM registry
    
4. Create a sample SDK project
    
5. Publishing the package to the Nexus Repo
    
6. Create a sample client project to consume the published package
    

Now time to get our hands dirty with implementation 🏗️

In this part, we will just focus on getting the Nexus repo up and running.

# 🗄️ Nexus Repo

### (1). Install Docker

It is straightforward, and you can just follow the [Docker official website](https://www.docker.com).

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1688200975429/4c6fdcad-87ab-4055-b332-289d6d0f04d9.png align="center")

You should have Docker running like in the above image (*Green Whale Status* 🐳 ).

### (2). Run a container of Nexus Repo

If you have never had experience with Docker before, don't panic. What we will be doing here is:

* Getting a copy of Nexus Repo *(in Docker, it is called an "Image")*
    
* Running the Nexus Repo *(in Docker, we run the container using the above image)*
    

Okay, first let's get the image from the Docker hub.

Because I am using Apple Silicon MacBook, I have to use this image [klo2k/nexus3](https://hub.docker.com/r/klo2k/nexus3). If you are using something else than mine (Windows or Intel-Mac), you should use this image [sonatype/nexus3](https://hub.docker.com/r/sonatype/nexus3/). It will be the same for the next steps for the two images.

<div data-node-type="callout-text">Question regarding running Nexus 3 on Apple Silicon MacBook. (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68990712/is-it-possible-to-run-sonatype-nexus3-docker-container-on-macos" style="pointer-events: none">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68990712/is-it-possible-to-run-sonatype-nexus3-docker-container-on-macos</a>)</div>
</div>

So simply run the below command in your terminal:

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name nexus klo2k/nexus3
```

or

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name nexus sonatype/nexus3
```

After done, you should have the container running (named `nexus`)

And when you go to `http://locahost:8081`, you should see as below too.

Great 🚀... let's sign in.

The default user name will be `admin`. And for getting the password, run the below command.

```bash
$ docker container exec nexus cat nexus-data/admin.password
```

Use the username and password to sign in. You will be required to:

* Set new password
    
* Configure Anonymous Access (Let's choose "**Disable anonymous access**")
    
* After done, you will get to see as below.

### Awesome 🎉 ... We have done with part one.

Let's stay tuned and check out part two once it is available.

## **👏 Thanks, cheers!**
